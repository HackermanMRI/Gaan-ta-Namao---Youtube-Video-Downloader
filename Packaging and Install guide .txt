Gaan ta Namao: Packaging and Installation Guide (Fresh Start)
This guide will walk you through the final steps of preparing your application for distribution, starting from your new Gaan ta Namao folder.

The process is in two main parts:

Part A: Packaging into a single .exe file using PyInstaller.

Part B: Creating a user-friendly Windows installer using Inno Setup.

Part A: Creating the Standalone .exe File
This process bundles your Python application, its dependencies, your logo, and FFmpeg into a single executable file that can run on any modern Windows computer.

Step 1: Prepare Your Project Folder
Before you begin, ensure your Gaan ta Namao project folder is clean and contains the following essential files:

main.py

downloader.py

utils.py

logo.png (Your application's logo)

ffmpeg.exe (The audio/video converter program)

Step 2: Install PyInstaller
Open your terminal, navigate to your Gaan ta Namao folder, activate your virtual environment, and install PyInstaller.

# Navigate to your project folder
cd "path\to\your\Gaan ta Namao"

# Make sure your venv is active
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

Step 3: Create the Icon File
PyInstaller requires a .ico file for the application icon. You can easily convert your logo.png using an online tool.

Go to a website like CloudConvert PNG to ICO.

Upload your logo.png.

Convert and download the logo.ico file.

Save logo.ico in the same Gaan ta Namao folder.

Step 4: Run the PyInstaller Command
This is the most important step. In your activated terminal, run the following command. It's a single long command, so copy it carefully.

pyinstaller --name "Gaan ta Namao" --windowed --onefile --add-data "logo.png;." --add-binary "ffmpeg.exe;." --icon="logo.ico" main.py

What this command does:

--name "Gaan ta Namao": Sets the final executable name to Gaan ta Namao.exe.

--windowed: Prevents a black console window from appearing when your app runs.

--onefile: Bundles everything into a single .exe file.

--add-data "logo.png;.": Includes your logo.png file in the package.

--add-binary "ffmpeg.exe;.": Crucially, this includes the ffmpeg.exe program inside your app package so it can convert files.

--icon="logo.ico": Sets the file icon for your .exe.

Step 5: Find Your Executable
After the command finishes, PyInstaller will create a new folder named dist. Inside this dist folder, you will find your final, standalone application: Gaan ta Namao.exe. You can now run this file on any Windows machine.

Part B: Creating the Windows Installer (setup.exe)
This step takes your .exe file and creates a professional installer that adds Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts.

Step 1: Download and Install Inno Setup
If you haven't already, download and install the Inno Setup compiler from its official website: https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Step 2: Create the Installer Script
In your main Gaan ta Namao project folder, create a new text file.

Name it installer_script.iss.

Copy and paste the entire script below into this file.

; Inno Setup Script for Gaan ta Namao

[Setup]
AppName=Gaan ta Namao
AppVersion=1.0
DefaultDirName={autopf}\Gaan ta Namao
DefaultGroupName=Gaan ta Namao
OutputBaseFilename=Gaan_ta_Namao_Setup
Compression=lzma2
SolidCompression=yes
WizardStyle=modern
UninstallDisplayIcon={app}\Gaan ta Namao.exe
AppPublisher=NS Limon

[Files]
; This tells the installer to grab your EXE from the dist folder
Source: "dist\Gaan ta Namao.exe"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion

[Icons]
; Start Menu Shortcut
Name: "{group}\Gaan ta Namao"; Filename: "{app}\Gaan ta Namao.exe"
; Desktop Shortcut
Name: "{autodesktop}\Gaan ta Namao"; Filename: "{app}\Gaan ta Namao.exe"; Tasks: desktopicon

[Tasks]
Name: "desktopicon"; Description: "Create a &desktop shortcut"; GroupDescription: "Additional shortcuts:"

Step 3: Compile the Installer
Open the Inno Setup Compiler application.

Go to File -> Open... and select your installer_script.iss file.

Click the Build -> Compile menu item.

Inno Setup will run and use your script to create the installer.

Step 4: Find Your Installer
A new folder named Output will be created inside your project directory. Inside it, you will find your final, shareable installer file: Gaan_ta_Namao_Setup.exe.

You are now ready to distribute your application! Congratulations!
